            Dylan's Fiesta MK3 L
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was fortunate enough to receive a MK3 Fiesta L as a gift from my dad's friend after his nephew had an unfortunate
            accident, putting the car into a ditch and damaging the front left side and breaking the plastic bumper. Despite the
            mishap, I am excited about this opportunity to own my own car and bring it back to its former glory. The car was
            originally registered in Donegal, and to the best of my knowledge, it has never left the area since then. It's
            interesting to think about the memories this little car holds and the places it has traveled within the beautiful
            landscapes of Donegal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The MK3 Fiesta L is a true classic, originally manufactured in Spain. It's a compact and reliable car, perfect for city
            commuting and everyday errands. While it may lack some of the optional extras found in newer models, its simplicity is
            part of its charm. The aqua blue color gives it a refreshing and distinct appearance on the roads, standing out from the
            sea of modern vehicles. Despite being a 1.1L petrol engine, it still holds its own and offers a smooth and enjoyable
            driving experience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As I take ownership of this MK3 Fiesta L, I'm looking forward to restoring it with love and care. Though it may have a
            few battle scars, I believe it has a lot of life left in it. I plan to fix the front left damage and replace the broken
            plastic bumper, bringing it back to its original condition as much as possible. This car holds sentimental value, coming
            from my dad's friend and representing the history of our local area. I can't wait to take it on adventures around
            Donegal, creating new memories and embracing the simplicity and charm of this little gem on wheels.

            <h2>
                Progress So Far
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Restoring a Fiesta mk3 L has been a challenging yet rewarding process, as evident from the considerable progress made so
                far. The restoration journey began with the meticulous removal of various exterior components, including the front
                lights, bumper, mud guards, flaps, and back lights. This step allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the car's
                condition and identified areas that needed attention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To address issues related to the car's performance and overall health, essential maintenance tasks were undertaken. The
                exhaust pipe was replaced, and the patched downpipe was fixed to ensure smooth and efficient exhaust flow. Furthermore,
                new spark plugs and oil were installed, contributing to improved engine performance and longevity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The restoration efforts also involved addressing cosmetic aspects of the car. The removal of side trim, badges, door
                cards, wind winders, sun visors, seats, and carpet allowed for a thorough clean-up and replacement with more
                aesthetically pleasing components. The inside trim received special attention to restore the interior's original charm
                and comfort.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A significant step in the restoration process was the removal of all undersealant and sanding of the undercarriage to
                deal with rust issues effectively. Rust is a common concern in older vehicles, especially in areas exposed to moisture
                and road salts. By addressing this problem, the structural integrity of the car was preserved, extending its lifespan.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                However, the restoration process did encounter some challenges along the way. The discovery of an electrical fault in
                the heater system, causing blown fuses, required troubleshooting and repair. This issue was addressed to ensure that all
                electrical components functioned correctly and safely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To tackle the problem of rust affecting the car's exterior, new front and wing panels were purchased. These panels were
                essential to replace the corroded sections and maintain the car's appearance and structural integrity. Procuring these
                parts demonstrated the commitment to a thorough and authentic restoration.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the progress made in restoring the Fiesta mk3 L is commendable. From the removal and replacement of
                exterior and interior components to addressing mechanical and electrical issues, the restoration effort has been
                comprehensive and dedicated. While challenges were encountered along the way, the determination to bring the car back to
                its former glory shines through the acquisition of replacement panels and the meticulous treatment of rust. With
                continued perseverance and attention to detail, the fully restored Fiesta mk3 L is sure to become a sight to behold and
                a testament to the rewards of classic car restoration.
